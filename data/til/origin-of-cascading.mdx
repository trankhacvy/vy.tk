# Origin of Cascading

- Style sheet may have three different origins: **author**, **user** and **user agent**.
- **Author** stylesheets are the most common type of style sheet. These are style sheets that define styles as part of the design of a given web page or site. The author of the page defines the styles for the document using one or more stylesheets, which define the look and feel of the website â€” its theme.
- **The user (or reader)** of the web site can choose to override styles in many browsers using a custom user stylesheet designed to tailor the experience to the user's wishes.
- The browser has a basic style sheet that gives a default style to any document. These style sheets are named user-agent stylesheets. Some browsers use actual style sheets for this purpose, while others simulate them in code, but the end result is the same
